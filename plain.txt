ADVDISC Group Project 2
Other Applications of Matrices and Linear Algebra in Computer Science Research Areas

Deadline: Dec 1, 2015 (Tuesday), 10:00 am

Write a program that shows the use of matrices and linear algebra in a specific research area in Computer Science.

The input and output depends on the topic. Thus, think/plan about this very well to ensure usability and proper user-interface.

Ensure also that the system is verifiable. Meaning, the system should display needed intermediate and final results/outputs to be able to check the correctness of the results.

Note the ff:

1. You will not be given a lecture on these topics. You have to do research and self-reading to enrich your knowledge in other areas in Computer Science.
2. You can choose any programming language but you cannot call libraries for the operations. That is, you have to program the operations with matrices.
3. You can call functions/methods for drawing only (ex. draw line).
4. Your code will be checked.
5. All members should contribute to the development of the software.

Deliverables

Submit on or before the deadline the ff:

1. code (online submission)
2. documentation (online submission and print out) to contain the ff:
	a. Cover page
	b. Contribution of each member
c. Introduction of the Research Area
d. Use of Matrices and Linear Algebra methods in the Research Area (discuss the formulae, matrices and operations, linear algebra methods used in the chosen topic, show illustrations and samples)
e. Design (discuss the architecture of your software (modules), discuss algorithms and data structures that shows the use of matrices, operations, linear algebra)
f. Implementation (discuss what language you used, what specific functions/methods you used, etc)
	g. Conclusion
